# Lab Project: Building and Managing a Fastify Node.js Web Server

## Overview

This lab focuses on building a Fastify Node.js web server and managing the project with Git and npm. Through a series of structured exercises, you will set up the project, configure the environment, handle version control, and implement basic routing with Fastify.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Create an initial Fastify Node.js web server**
- **Initialize a Node.js project folder using Node Package Manager (npm)**
- **Add Fastify to the project using npm, and test using Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
- **Add a Git repository, exclude the node_modules folder from Git, and make commits**
- **Fix MIME errors, test, and commit**
- **Add a second route with query parameters, test, and commit**

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Create Initial Fastify Node.js Web Server

- Set up a basic Fastify web server to handle HTTP requests and responses.

### Part 2: Initialize as a Node.js Project Folder Using npm

- Initialize the project directory as a Node.js project using npm to manage dependencies.

### Part 3: Add Fastify to Project Using npm, and Test Using VSCode

- Install Fastify via npm and verify the setup by testing the server in Visual Studio Code.

### Part 4: Add Git Repo, Exclude node_modules Folder from Git, Make Commits

- Initialize a Git repository, add necessary files, exclude the `node_modules` folder, and make initial commits.

### Part 5: Fix MIME Error, Test, and Commit

- Identify and resolve MIME type errors, test the solution, and commit the changes to the repository.

### Part 6: Add a Second Route with Query Parameters, Test, and Commit

- Implement a second route in the Fastify server that handles query parameters, test the functionality, and commit the updates.

By completing this lab, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing a Node.js web server with Fastify, handling project dependencies with npm, and maintaining version control with Git.
