# Lab Project: Building and Managing a Fastify Node.js Web Server

Throughout this lab project, I focused on building a Fastify Node.js web server and effectively managing the project with Git and npm. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab was designed to guide me through setting up a Fastify Node.js web server, configuring the environment, managing dependencies with npm, and implementing basic routing with Fastify.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Creating an Initial Fastify Node.js Web Server:** I set up a basic Fastify web server to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- **Initializing a Node.js Project Folder Using npm:** I initialized the project directory as a Node.js project using npm to manage dependencies.
- **Adding Fastify to Project Using npm, and Testing Using VSCode:** I installed Fastify via npm and verified the setup by testing the server in Visual Studio Code.
- **Adding a Git Repository, Excluding node_modules Folder from Git, and Making Commits:** I initialized a Git repository, added necessary files, excluded the `node_modules` folder, and made initial commits to track project changes.
- **Fixing MIME Error, Testing, and Committing:** I identified and resolved MIME type errors, tested the solution, and committed the changes to the repository.
- **Adding a Second Route with Query Parameters, Testing, and Committing:** I implemented a second route in the Fastify server that handles query parameters, tested the functionality, and committed the updates.

## Lab Experience

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of exercises that allowed me to:

- Set up a Fastify Node.js web server efficiently.
- Initialize and manage project dependencies using npm.
- Configure and test the Fastify server in Visual Studio Code.
- Maintain version control of the project using Git, while excluding unnecessary files from tracking.
- Identify and resolve errors in the server configuration, ensuring smooth operation.
- Implement additional routes with specific functionalities, expanding the capabilities of the web server.

By completing this lab, I gained valuable hands-on experience in setting up and managing a Node.js web server with Fastify, handling project dependencies with npm, and maintaining version control with Git.
